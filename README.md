## Author: Brandon Mizutani

Version: 1.0.0 (PR URL: [PR URL](https://github.com/bran2miz/django-api-travels/pull/1)

## Overview

This lab assignment required us to use Django REST Framework to create an API, then “containerize” it with Docker.

## Getting Started

### Lab 28

We had to create a project that followed the same steps as the previous lab, only this time we had to used the Django REST Framework to create an api and use Docker desktop. We had to:

- Rebuild a custom version of Things API demo project from scratch.

- Replace things_project and Thing with your own application and model.

- Your model must have at least as many fields as demo’s model.

- Your model must have one field that is a foreign key to user.

We also had to utilize docker to:

- Update Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml if needed.

## Architecture

Python, Django, Models, get_user_model, superuser, CRUD, Docker, REST.

## Change Log

03-17-22 -- Pages render as expected and assignment is complete.
